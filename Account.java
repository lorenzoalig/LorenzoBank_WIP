/**
 * This class creates instances of bank accounts with basic attributes and basic operations,such as deposit,
 * withdrawal, and transfers between accounts.
 * 
 * It includes the following attributes:
 * 
 *  - Username (must be available)
 *  - Password
 *  - Account code
 *  - Balance
 * 
 * During account creation, the class also checks if the username is available (in the database), automatically assigns
 * an account code, and adds the account to the database.
 * 
 * Disclaimer: This is not the final version. Its purpose is for testing only. Further documentation to be added.
